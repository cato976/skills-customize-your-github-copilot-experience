# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will build a simple API that handles basic CRUD operations for a resource, practicing modern web development skills.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ FastAPI CRUD API Implementation

#### Description
Create a REST API using FastAPI that allows users to create, read, update, and delete items (e.g., books, tasks, or notes). The API should use in-memory storage (a Python list or dictionary) and expose endpoints for each operation.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Use FastAPI to define API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Store items in a Python list or dictionary
- Allow clients to create new items via POST
- Allow clients to retrieve all items or a single item via GET
- Allow clients to update an item via PUT or PATCH
- Allow clients to delete an item via DELETE
- Return appropriate status codes and error messages

### 🛠️ API Documentation and Testing

#### Description
Add automatic API documentation using FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI support. Test your API using the interactive docs or a tool like curl/Postman.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Include OpenAPI documentation (auto-generated by FastAPI)
- Provide example requests and responses in the README
- Include instructions for running and testing the API
