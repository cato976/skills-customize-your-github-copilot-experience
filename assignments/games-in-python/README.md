## 🎯 Objective

Build a classic Hangman game in Python to practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and random selection. You will create an interactive word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a hidden word before running out of attempts.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Hangman Game Implementation

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where the player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word. The game should provide feedback after each guess and track the number of incorrect attempts remaining.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses from the player
- Display the current progress (e.g., _ a _ _ m a n)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Show a win or lose message at the end

### 🛠️ Game Enhancement (Optional)

#### Description
Add at least one enhancement to your Hangman game to make it more fun or challenging. Examples include adding a graphical display, allowing the player to choose difficulty, or keeping score across multiple rounds.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Include a graphical or text-based display of the hangman
- Allow the player to select difficulty (word length, number of attempts)
- Keep track of score or rounds played
